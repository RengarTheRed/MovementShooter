# Movement Shooter
Movement Shooter made as a project for my Mastered Bootcamp. This game is a 1st-person shooter with a major emphasis on movement mechanics such as crouch sliding, wall-running and gravity manipulation (Gravity is being 'dropped').
Please bear in mind that this project is very early in development so many things listed below may not be implemented yet.

## Instructions 
To open downloaded project in editor (bear in mind external assets (Art etc) are not being pushed as it would violate EULA)
1. Unzip project if downloaded as ZIP
2. Open Unity projects tab
3. Click Open
4. Navigate to project root folder
5. Click Open

## External Assets
For external assets please make a folder named "External" in the Asset folder and follow the below instructions. I will not be providing these assets as these are all paid and are subject to their own EULA's.
These assets are required for this project to work as is (some pieces may work without). Please view the asset list to see all that's required.

### Getting project to work with Synty Sci-Fi Space
1. Follow the above instructions.
2. Create a folder named "Synty" within the "External" folder.
3. Import the Synty Sci-Fi Space Pack
4. Move the folder created into the Synty Folder

There will be a build version in many weeks time.
